Run `python3 src/main.py` to run simulation. Adjust parameters as needed. The dafault parameters, at the time of writing, take a long time to run (2-3hours)

Fill in src/plotter.py with a run info and run `python3 src/plotter.py` to see the plot of that run. Don't forget to rename the labels/title accordingly
